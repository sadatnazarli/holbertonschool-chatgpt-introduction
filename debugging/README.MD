# Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices. This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: debugging and automation. By engaging with these tasks, youâ€™ll learn how to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to not only identify and resolve errors more efficiently but also to automate repetitive coding tasks, thereby increasing your productivity and improving the quality of your code.

## Objectives

- **Debugging:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples. Enhance problem-solving skills by addressing common programming pitfalls.
- **Automation:** Leverage ChatGPT to automate mundane coding tasks, such as generating documentation and boilerplate code.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Debugging - Python Factorial
**Purpose:** Identify and fix errors in a Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number. The original code enters an infinite loop, which needs correction.

### 1. Debugging - Python Arguments
**Purpose:** Modify a Python script to ensure it prints only the command-line arguments provided, excluding the script name.

### 2. Debugging - HTML / JavaScript
**Purpose:** Correct an HTML/JavaScript code snippet so that a button properly changes the background color of the webpage when clicked. The original issue is a typo in the button's `id`.

### 3. Debugging - Python Minesweeper
**Purpose:** Implement a mechanism in a Python Minesweeper game to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, allowing the player to win the game. The task involves enhancing the game logic.

### 4. Documentation - Python Factorial
**Purpose:** Add comments to a Python script that calculates factorials using recursion. The comments should include sections for the function description, parameters, and return values.

### 5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook
**Purpose:** Introduce error handling to a Python Checkbook application to prevent crashes due to invalid input, such as non-numeric values during deposits or withdrawals.

### 6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python
**Purpose:** Identify and correct multiple errors in a Python Tic Tac Toe game. This task emphasizes ensuring the correct player is declared the winner and handling various edge cases in the game.

## Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills:** Develop confidence in troubleshooting and refining code, using AI to assist in resolving errors.
- **Automation Proficiency:** Learn to use AI tools to automate coding tasks, leading to cleaner, more structured, and error-free code.

Through this project, you will engage in hands-on activities that reflect real-world scenarios, pushing the boundaries of traditional coding methods with AI integration. This approach not only prepares you for future technological advancements but also equips you with skills that are increasingly in demand in the tech industry.
